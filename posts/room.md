Room is a service that aims to help and facilitate people in the process of creating and managing guestbooks and events. In a simple way, Room is a digital guestbook.

The idea for Room came from the struggle I experienced myself, such as managing an offline event, recording the attendance list of the organization, and filling in the guestbook manually. What I mean by "manually" is writing on a piece of paper. Let me tell you, it is a pain in the ass. Because most of the time, from that piece of paper, I still have to input it to a computer, so it's like double the work.

So with Room, I aim to make the whole process easier and simpler, with what we call "One Step Scanning". All you need to do is show the barcode we generated for you on the website, and then the event organizer just needs to scan the barcode, and voila, it's done â€“ your name is in the guestbook. You don't have to write it again, you don't have to wait in line because the person in front of you writes slowly. If you're in the event organizer, say goodbye to those hard-to-read ugly handwriting things. Now you can customize your guestbook anywhere and everywhere as long as you have an internet connection. The form of the guestbook is highly customizable, and even better, say goodbye to those complicated processes I mentioned earlier. You don't have to double the work anymore; all you need to do is export the data, and it will give you a CSV file to work with.

Room is a group project in my college, made by me and my friends, Fira and Meiliana. For the backend, we use Node.js; for the frontend, we use CSS and Bootstrap, and for the database, we use MongoDB. This is my first big project, so I would say this is one of the most challenging projects I've made. One of the most challenging parts for me, as I remembered, is the export function, because this is something I haven't done, but a great lesson indeed. Click this link to visit our [github](https://github.com/Bryan-snw/Room), and for the [Room](https://room-idn.com/), and for the Room website. If the link to the website is not working, then sadly, it means that the duration of my hosting has already run out :(, but don't worry about that. Lucky for you, we have a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@room7833), and there's a video where I demonstrate how to use the website, and I will show you a few pictures of the website too.
