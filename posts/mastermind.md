Mastermind is a captivating web game that draws inspiration from the timeless classic bearing the same name, which originally emerged from the creative mind of Mordecai Meirowitz in 1970.

The essence of Mastermind remains intact in this web version. It was originally designed for two players, where one player creates a secret code using colors, and the other player tries to crack the code within a limited number of attempts. The game's essence is rooted in the fine arts of deduction, strategy, logical reasoning, and discerning recurring patterns. As you engage further, the better you will become at narrowing down the possibilities and making smarter guesses with each round.

My journey with Mastermind began when my dad introduced me to the game a few months ago. He had bought the physical board game, and we started playing it together. What draws me to this game is the engrossing interplay between clues, patterns, and the logical dance that unfolds. Every detail matters, requiring a keen eye for order and structure. In the process, our brains are finely tuned to think logically while having an abundance of fun.

What's even more intriguing is that this website game came to life upon my father's request â€“ a whimsical twist of fate, indeed. When he wondered aloud about the complexity of crafting the game, I couldn't resist the challenge. With a clear vision in mind, I saw it as an opportunity to prove my capabilities. After all, it was my first foray into creating this particular kind of website game, and I figured, "Why not take the plunge?" This experience has been a novel addition to my programming journey, one that I undertook with eagerness and a desire to excel.

I used Next.js and Tailwind CSS to build the website. I took a slightly different approach, though. Instead of two players, the game now allows you to play against the computer. The computer generates a secret code, and your task is to crack it. Currently, the game doesn't use a database, so it's more like a play-reset-play cycle. However, I'm considering adding more features and functionalities in the future.

This project holds a special place in my heart as one of the most enjoyable endeavors I've undertaken. The game's evolution continues as I consider potential updates and features to elevate the experience. Curious to experience the thrill for yourself?
