Daily Quotes is a platform dedicated to sharing positivity, kindness, and motivation through inspiring quotes. The website is designed to bring people together and help spread positivity in a world that can sometimes feel overwhelming.

The main purpose of creating this website was to create a community of like-minded individuals who support each other and lift each other up. We believe that through the power of words and positive thinking, we can all overcome any obstacle and achieve our dreams. in Daily Quotes you can generate a random quotes or you can contribute to the community and post your message.

To build this website, I used Laravel for the back-end and Bootstrap for the front-end, database using MySQL, and for the prototype design, I used Figma. This project is simple yet fun project to make, this project is made to test my knowledge in laravel. You can check out the project on my [github](https://github.com/Bryan-snw/daily_quotes) page for more details. i don't host this website, but i will show you a few picture of the website.
