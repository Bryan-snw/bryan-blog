Room is a website-based application service that aims to help and facilitate people in the process of creating and managing guestbook and events. in a simple way Room is a digital guestbook.

The idea of Room came from the struggle i've experienced myself, such as manage an offline event, record the attendance list of the organizationn and fill in guestbook manually. What i mean with manually is writting on the piece of paper. And let met tell you it is pain in the ass. Because most of the time, from that piece of paper, i still got to input it to a computer so it's like double the work.

So with Room, i aim to make the whole process easier and simpler, with what we called "One Step Scanning". because all you need to do is, show the barcode we generated for you in the website, and then the event organizer just need to scan the barcode, and voila, it's done your name is in the guestbook. you don't have to write it again, you don't have to wait in line because the person in front of you write slowly or if you're in the event organizer, say goodbye to those hard to read ugly writting things. now you can customize your guestbook anywhere and everywhere as long as you have internet connection. and the form of the guestbook is highly customizable, and even better say goodbye to those complicated process i said earlier, you don't have to double the work anymore, all you need is to export the data and it will give you a csv file to work with.

Room is a group project in my college, made by me and my friends, fira and meiliana. for the back-end we use NodeJs, the front-end we use CSS and bootstrap. and the database we use MongoDB. this is my first big project, so i would say this is one of the most challenging project i've made. one of the most hardest part for me as i remembered, is the export function, because this is something i haven't done, but a great lesson indeed. Click this link to [github](https://github.com/Bryan-snw/Room), and for the [Room](https://room-idn.com/). if the link to the website is not working then sadly it's mean that, the duration of my hosting is already run out :(, but don't need to worry about that, lucky for you we have a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@room7833) and there's a video where i demonstrate how to use the website, and i will show you a few picture of the website too.
