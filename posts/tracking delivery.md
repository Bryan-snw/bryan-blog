Tracking Delivery is a website for a certain company that offers shipping or delivery services. The website aims to help their customers keep track of their package delivery status.

The idea of this website is basically just for a portfolio website, to challenge and test my skills and knowledge. So to be honest, I don't really have much to say about this website. Tracking Delivery is just a simple website where the company or admin can create a resi number (package ID) for their customers to track and update the status of the package delivery in every step. As for the customers, they can track their package delivery status using the resi number the company gives them.

Tracking Delivery is a portfolio project made by me alone. This website is built using Next.js, the database using MySQL, and for the prototype design, I used Figma. The challenge in this project, to be honest, is really simple, which is to make a connection with MySQL. But on my defense, it's been a long time since I used MySQL because most of the time, i enjoyed more using MongoDB. And i know the design look really simple, like really simple but that because i kind of want to do a speed-run working on this project and just focus on the main functionality. Click this link to [github](https://github.com/Bryan-snw/Tracking-Delivery) and no, i don't host this website, but i will show you a few picture of the website.
