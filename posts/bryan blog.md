Welcome to my personal blog portfolio website! My name is Judith Bryan Leonard Sie, and I'm a recent computer science graduate based in Indonesia. I'm particularly interested in web development and aspire to become a full-stack web developer. As you explore "Bryan's Blog," my portfolio site, I'll be sharing my work with you in the form of blog posts.

The aim of this website is to provide an easy way for me to showcase my work without needing to open and run each project separately. You may be wondering why I don't just host these websites for free; the answer is that I'm trying to save my budget. While there are plenty of free hosting options available, I believe that certain small projects don't necessarily require hosting. If I do decide to host a project, I'll provide the link in the relevant post.

Please note that the date of each post doesn't indicate when I created the project; rather, it reflects the date of the post itself. I plan to write about past projects, so the date won't always indicate the latest work. While my English may not be perfect, I choose to use it because I feel more comfortable expressing myself in English and it's good practice for me.

I built this website using Next.js with plain CSS for the front-end. I try not to use CSS frameworks so that I can hone my CSS skills, but I may use one in the future. To display my posts, I use react-markdown, which allows me to customize them to some extent. You can find the code on [github](https://github.com/Bryan-snw/bryan-blog), although please keep in mind that the website is a work in progress and there may be bugs or features that I haven't added yet.

Finally, I won't include a picture of the website because if you've not noticed, you're already on it! Thank you for visiting, and have a wonderful day.

Best regards,

Judith Bryan Leonard Sie
