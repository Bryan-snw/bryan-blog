Tracking delivery is a website for a certain company that offer a shipping or delivery service. the website aims to help their customers to keep track of their package delivery status.

The idea of this website is basicaly just for a portfolio website, to challange and testing my skill and knowledge. So to be honest, i don't really have much to say about this website. Tracking delivery is just a simple website where the company or admin, can make a resi number (package id) for their customers to track, and update the status of the package delivery in every step. As for the customers, they can track their package delivery status using the resi number the company give them.

Tracking Delivery is a portofolio project made by me alone. This website is build using NextJS, the database using MySql and for the prototype design using Figma. the challange in this project for me, to be honest is really simple.. which is to make connection with MySql.. but on my defense tho, it's been a long time since i used MySql, because most of the time i enjoyed more using MongoDB. And i know the design look really simple, like really simple but that because i kind of want to do a speed-run working on this project and just focus on the main functionality. Click this link to [github](https://github.com/Bryan-snw/Tracking-Delivery) and no, i don't host this website, but i will show you a few picture of the website.
