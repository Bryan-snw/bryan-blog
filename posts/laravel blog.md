Laravel's Blog is a website that showcases my skill and knowledge in web development. It is a platform for posting blogs, literally like every blog website in the world. The only difference is that this website was created by me using Laravel.

The main purpose of creating this website was to use it as a portfolio to showcase my skills and what I can achieve with Laravel. As for the features, anyone can read the blogs posted by the authors, filter the blogs by category or author, and leave comments. However, authors must create an account in order to make a post, categorize their posts, and edit or delete them as needed. Admins have the added ability to add, edit, and delete categories.

To build this website, I used Laravel for the back-end and Bootstrap for the front-end. I also incorporated the Trix editor to allow authors to customize their posts to some extent. However, since this was my first time using Laravel and implementing the MVC concept, there were some challenges that I had to overcome. It took some time to get used to, but in the end, it was a valuable learning experience. You can check out the project on my [github](https://github.com/Bryan-snw/bryan-blog) page for more details. i don't host this website, but i will show you a few picture of the website.
