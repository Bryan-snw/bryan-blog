Python Blog is a website that serves as a showcase of my skills and knowledge in web development, specifically using Python Flask. It functions as a platform for posting blogs, much like any other blogging website. The distinctive factor is that I personally crafted this site using Python Flask.

The primary goal behind creating this website was to establish it as a portfolio, highlighting my proficiency and accomplishments with Python Flask. In terms of features, visitors can read blogs. Authors, however, need to create an account to publish, categorize their posts, and manage them (edit or delete).

In the development process, I utilized Python Flask for the back-end and bootstrap for the front-end. The integration of the CKEditor to empowers authors to customize their posts. As this was my first time working with Python Flask, there were initial challenges to overcome. It took some time to adapt, but the experience was valuable.
