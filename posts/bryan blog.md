Hello, welcome to my personal blog portofolio website. in this website i plan to post all my work in the form of a blog. I will talk about the idea of the website, the struggle i experienced, what i used to build the website and some picture of the website.

My name is Judith Bryan Leonard Sie, i'm a fresh graduate in computer science, i'm based in Indonesia. I have great interest at software development especially at web development and as for now i want to become a full-stack web developer. As you know "Bryan's Blog" is a my blog portofolio, so this post is just for an introduction and to give you some information about this webstie.

The idea of this website is that i able to show my work with ease, so i don't really have to open and run project a, b, c, and so on to show you what i've been working on. Maybe you'll ask why not host those website? Well the answer is, to save some budget of mine. I know there's a lot of free hosting out there, for example this website is hosted on vercel free, but i think there's some little project that not really need to be hosted. So in the meantime i will do it like this. But if somehow i decided to host the website i will share the link at that post. Note: the date of the post is not the date i make the project, it is literally just the date of the post, because i plan to post about my project in the past too, so the date doesn't really determined if that's my latest work or not.

This website is build using NextJs. The front-end is just a plain CSS, i try to not using CSS framework to train my CSS skill but, it doesn't mean i will not use one in the future. For the data of the posts, i'm using react-markdown so at least i can customize the post a little with the help of react-markdown. Here the link to the [github](https://github.com/Bryan-snw/bryan-blog). This website is not perfect there's still some flaw, bug, and feature i haven't add yet, but worry not, i'll always update the code. I think don't need to show you a picture of the website, because if you haven't realized, you're literally at the website, so have a wonderfull day.

Best regards,

Judith Bryan Leonard Sie
